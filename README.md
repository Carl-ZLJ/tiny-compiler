### Tiny Compiler

- The origin repo: [The super tiny compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler)
- something about compiler
- using TDD


#### Steps
- Parsing
    - Lexical Analysis
        - takes raw code into tokens by a **tokenizer** or **lexer**
    - Syntactic Analysis
        - takes the tokens and reformats them into a representation that describes
        each part of the syntax and their relation to one another
        - this is known as intermediate representation or **abstract syntax tree**
